					<br><br>
						<div class="details">
						<span class="text-description" style="font-size: 1.1em">
							<p>I created VRuddy as a way to practice and challenge myself as a developer. I wanted to improve my abilities and go deeper into the Java language. The app gave me the opportunity to familiarize myself with using OKHttp, JSON, and working with APIs. I also wanted to take everything I had learned and apply it to one project, and VRuddy allowed me to do that. I am proud to have developed this app as it allowed me to improve my skills and gain more knowledge about different technologies.</p>

						<div class="details">
							<span class="text-description" style="font-size: 1.1em">
								<p>In the future, I plan to continue improving the VRuddy app by implementing a number of new features and enhancements. One of the key areas of focus will be to add a dark theme to the app, which will provide users with a more comfortable viewing experience in low-light environments. This will involve updating the app&apos;s color scheme, as well as its layout and design elements to be more suitable for a dark theme.</p>
<p>Another important aspect of my improvement plan is to work on the app&apos;s code base. This will involve refactoring and optimizing the existing code to make it more efficient, scalable and maintainable. This will help to improve the app&apos;s performance, as well as make it easier to add new features in the future.</p>
<p>I also plan to improve the app&apos;s stability and solidity. This will involve implementing more robust error handling and testing mechanisms to ensure that the app is able to handle unexpected situations and errors without crashing.</p>
<p>In addition, I will be adding test units to the app to make sure that all the features are working as expected. This will help to ensure the quality of the app, and make it easier to identify and fix any bugs that may arise.</p>
<p>Overall, my goal is to make the VRuddy app a more polished and user-friendly experience for all users, and I am confident that these planned improvements will help to achieve this goal.</p>

						<div class="details">
							<span class="text-description" style="font-size: 1.1em">
								<p>The process of creating the VRuddy app was a challenging and rewarding journey. The idea for the app came about as I was looking for a project that would allow me to practice and apply the various principles and concepts that I had learned in my android development studies. I came up with the idea of creating a YouTube-like app, as it would involve working with APIs, handling and storing local data, playing stream videos, and utilizing complex Fragments and Views.</p>
<p>When I first started working on the project, my skills in android development were still relatively basic. However, as I faced new challenges and obstacles throughout the development process, I found that I was constantly improving and becoming more proficient in various aspects of the field. One of the key takeaways from this project was the importance of utilizing a clean and well-structured architecture, such as the MVVM design pattern.</p>
<p>Additionally, this project helped me to develop my problem-solving and information-seeking skills, as I often had to find solutions and information on my own. One of the most interesting aspects of this journey was the urge to share my knowledge and experience with others, and help others who are facing similar challenges. Overall, the process of creating the VRuddy app was a valuable learning experience that helped me to grow and develop as a developer.</p>

							<span class="text-description" style="font-size: 1.1em">
								<p>I faced a number of obstacles and difficulties throughout the development process. Despite the challenges, I was able to overcome them and develop my skills as a developer.</p>
<p>One of the main challenges I faced was my lack of experience in android development. When I first started working on the project, I had only a basic level of knowledge in the field. This made it difficult to implement certain features and concepts, such as working with APIs, handling and storing local data, playing stream videos, and utilizing complex Fragments and Views. However, as I progressed through the project, I was able to improve my skills and become more proficient in these areas.</p>
<p>Another challenge I faced was the importance of utilizing a clean and well-structured architecture, such as the MVVM design pattern. At first, I did not fully understand the importance of this architecture and saw it as an extra step that was not necessary. However, as the project grew in complexity and size, I realized that it was essential for managing the project and making it more maintainable in the long run.</p>
<p>In addition, I faced the challenge of problem-solving and information-seeking. Throughout the development process, I often had to find solutions and information on my own and this helped me to develop my problem-solving and information-seeking skills.</p>
<p>Overall, the process of creating the VRuddy app was a valuable learning experience that helped me to overcome the challenges and develop my skills as a developer. The app was a challenging project but the result was a great achievement and it was a chance to develop my skills and gain knowledge.</p>
